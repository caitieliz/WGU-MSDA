## Introduction

I entered the Master of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA) program at Western Governors University (WGU) in August 2024, with a background in Biomedical Sciences and no prior experience in data analytics. My goal is to graduate in May 2025. 

Throughout this program, I have built a strong foundation in data analysis, learning to use tools and techniques such as Python, SQL, data visualization, and machine learning. This repository showcases the projects I have completed during my journey, reflecting my growth and the skills I have acquired.

## Technologies Used

- Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
- SQL: For database management, querying, and data extraction.
- Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
- PostgreSQL: For relational database management.
- Jupyter Notebook: For documenting and sharing analysis.
